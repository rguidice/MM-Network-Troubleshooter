# MagicMirror Network Troubleshooter

Created to deal with network troubleshooting on a Raspberry Pi with a MagicMirror setup deployed. If the network is down, the scripts will manage adding a new wi-fi network (both WPA/WPA2 and WPA2 Enterprise) then reboot and ensure there is a network connection before starting the MagicMirror.
